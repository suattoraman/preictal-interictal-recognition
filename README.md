# Automatic recognition of preictal and interictal EEG signals using 1D-Capsule Networks

In this study, capsule networks, which are a new method of deep learning, are proposed for the preictal/interictal recognition. Unlike the existing CNN models, capsule networks separate the neurons in the layer by grouping them into a certain number of capsules. Thanks to these neuron groups, the preictal/interictal classification are performed. Two channels (channels 3 and 6) were selected for classification. Selected channels were examined for all cases. Average classification accuracy for channel 6 was 97.74%.  CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset was used for the study.
